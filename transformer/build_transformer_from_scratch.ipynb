    "- The input `X` is `[batch−size, sequence−length]`, we use ‘padding’ to fill the matrix with 0 with respect to the longest sequence.\n",
    "- But this will case issues for the softmax computation. This means the padding sections join the computation, but they shouldn’t. \n",
    "- So we create this mask to ignore these area by assign a large negative bias. Thus, the masked area will lead to 0 so we avoid them in computation. We use mini-batch data as input, means we feed multiply lines of sentences into the model for training and computation."
